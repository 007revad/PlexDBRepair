## How to contribute

As this tool becomes more popular, it also becomes more important to coordinate and document our work.

To contribute to the project,  please follow the following instructions:

### Open an Issue describing the problem or enhancement.
  - Add a label to the issue

### When submitting your work for review and merge:

1. Prior to opening a pull request,
   - Be certain to REBASE prior to opening the PR
   - Squash multiple commits into a single commit.
   - Clean up the commit message after squashing.
   - Use force-push if needed to unify all changes.

2. Open the pull request against the 'contribute' branch.

3. In the pull request, provide a description of what change(s) where made
   - Add the text:   `Fixes:`  followed by the URL of the open Issue
     eg:   Fixes:   https://ChuckPa/PlexDBRepair/issues/12    (if we were fixing issue 12)

   - Adding the above text+http tag has the following impact:
   - The Issue which prompted the change is forever linked to the PR making documentation easy.

5. Be certain to request review with your pull request.

6. Upon completion of review and testing, contributions will be merged into master.
   When the PR is approved and merged,  Github will automatically mark the issue as closed and solved.


### Policy

While questions, suggestions, enhancement requests, and bug fixes are welcome and almost always implemented,
it's not possible to accept PRs without an accompanying issue documention which justifies the change.
