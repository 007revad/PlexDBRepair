## How to contribute

As this tool becomes more popular, it also becomes more important to coordinate and document our work.

To contribute to the project,  please follow the following instructions:

### Open an Issue describing the problem or enhancement.
  - Add a label to the issue


### When submitting your work for review and merge:

1. Prior to opening a pull request,
   - Squash multiple commits into a single commit.
   - Clean up the commit message after squashing.
   - Use force-push to unify all changes.

2. In the pull request, provide a description of what change(s) where made

3. In the pull request,  add the text:   `Fixes:`  followed by the URL of the open Issue
    eg:   Fixes:   https://ChuckPa/PlexDBRepair/issues/12    (if we were fixing issue 12)

4. Adding the above text+http tag has the following impact:
  - The Issue which prompted the change is forever linked to the PR making documentation easy.
  - When the PR is approved and merged to master,  Github will automatically mark the issue as closed and solved.

### Policy

While questions, suggestions, enhancement requests, and bug fixes are welcome and almost always implemented,
it's not possible to accept PRs without an accompanying issue documention which justifies the change.
